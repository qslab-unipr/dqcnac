# DQC-NAC: a compiler for Distributed Quantum Computing

DQC-NAC is compiler package that can distribute monolithic quantum circuits written as DAGCircuits, into a distributed quantum circuit.
It allows to assign qubits to different QPUs in a quantum network, and insert remote gates to handle quantum gates between across QPU's.

# Installation

To install in your python environment, run:
```
pip install dist/dqcnac-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
