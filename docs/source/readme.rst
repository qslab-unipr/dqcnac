DQC-NAC: a compiler for Distributed Quantum Computing
=====================================================

DQC-NAC is compiler package that can distribute monolithic quantum circuits into distributed quantum circuits.
It allows to assign qubits to different QPUs in a quantum network, trying to optimize the number of non-local gates across QPUs.

Installation
============

To install in your python environment, run:

::

   pip install dist/dqcnac-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl
